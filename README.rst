Computational Mechanics (compmech)
==================================

This repository was built with the intention to become a collection of
theories and implementations on the field of Mechanics.

The details about the theories and the implementation are given 
in `the theories section <https://github.com/saullocastro/compmech/blob/master/theories/README.rst/>`_.
 

Implemented modules 
-------------------

laminated composite cones and cylinders under axial compression, torsion
and pressure. <https://github.com/saullocastro/compmech/blob/master/doc/conecyl/README.rst/>`_

Requirements
------------
- numpy
- scipy
- cython and a C compiler
- mapy (modeling-analysis-python at https://github.com/saullocastro/mapy)
