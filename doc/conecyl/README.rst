Semi-analytical models for conical and cylindrical shells (conecyl)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The semi-analytical tools contained in this module were initially
developed in the context of the European Project DESICOS
(http://www.desicos.eu).

The theory and implementation of this module are detailed
`here <https://github.com/saullocastro/compmech/blob/master/theories/conecyl/README.rst/>`_.
