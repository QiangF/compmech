Semi-analytical models for conical and cylindrical shells (conecyl)
===================================================================

A semi-analytical approach for the linear and non-linear buckling analysis of
imperfect unstiffened laminated composite cylinders and cones under axial, 
torsion and pressure loads.

The contained in this module were initially developed in the context
of the European Project DESICOS (http://www.desicos.eu).
